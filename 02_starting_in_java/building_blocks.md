## Building Blocks of a Programming Language

Almost every programming language out there has a number of basics building blocks required to solve problems and build programs.

### Variables

The base of almost any computer program is the manipulation of data. Of course before a program can manipulate data it needs to be able to store it. For this it can use the computer memory. This computer memory is accessed via **variables**. Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.

### Operators

Most programs will performs some sort of operations on data they have at their disposal. We often say that they process the data. For this processing a programming language needs all sorts of **operators**. Some examples are mathematical operators or text operators.

### Decision Making

Computer programs often have different things to do based on a certain situation. At certain points in the code, a decision has to be made. This requires that a **decision making** construct is available.

### Loop Constructs

Software is ideal for executing repetitive tasks (things that have to be done multiple times). To be able to do things multiple times a programming languages needs some sort **loop constructs**.
