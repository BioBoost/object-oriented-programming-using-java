# Message Queuing Telemetry Transport

MQTT, short for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport is actually a machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely **lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol**. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is limited. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimized data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers (more...). Basically MQTT is one of pillars of the Internet of Things.
