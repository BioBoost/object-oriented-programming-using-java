## Variables

A variable is a **symbolic name** for information. The variable's name should represent what information the variable contains. They are called variables because they represent **information that can change**.

Computer memory can be thought of a huge cabinet with millions of small drawers. The content of the drawers is the information stored in memory that we use inside our application. While it is perfectly possible to refer to a drawer using its location (for example second row, third column), it is a lot harder to remember. There is also no link between the location and the actual content of the drawer. Now if we place a label on the drawer that is descriptive enough of its content, which is the analogy of our **variable name**, it is much easier to refer to the drawer using the descriptive name (for example nine inch nails).
