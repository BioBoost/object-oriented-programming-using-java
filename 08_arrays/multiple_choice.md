## Chapter 08 - Arrays - Multiple Choice

1. What is not a property of arrays in Java?

    * [ ] The first element is always placed at index `0`
    * [ ] The size of an array is determined after instantiation and can be changed later
    * [ ] Arrays can also be used to store references to objects
    * [ ] The elements are stored in memory as a sequential ordered list

2. Suppose you have the following array of integers in memory. How can you print the third element of the array?

    ![Array of ints](./img/my_list.png)

   * [ ] `System.out.println("The number = " + myList(2));`
   * [ ] `System.out.println("The number = " + myList[3]);`
   * [ ] `System.out.println("The number = " + myList[2]);`
   * [ ] `System.out.println("The number = " + 11662);`
