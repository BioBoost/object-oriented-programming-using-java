## Conditions

To allow our program to make certain decisions we first need to take a look at conditions and how they are evaluated.

A condition is some sort of comparison (or a combination of comparisons) that can be evaluated by the compiler or interpreter. After solving all comparisons and combining all the individual parts, the compiler resolves it to a single resulting value that is `true` or `false` (also keywords in Java), which are actually values the data type `boolean` can take. Generally spoken we state that the compiler evaluates the condition to be true or false.

The true and false values can differ from language to language, however internal in memory false is most of the time "0" and true is "not 0".
