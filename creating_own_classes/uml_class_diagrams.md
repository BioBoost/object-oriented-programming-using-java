## UML Class Diagrams

When creating an application it can often be useful to put some diagrams on paper on how you are going to take on the problem. One of the most used diagrams in the world of object oriented programming is the UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram.

A class diagram is a static diagram that describes the attributes and methods of a class and the also the relationships between the different classes in an application. Class diagrams are widely used in the modeling of object oriented systems because they are the only UML diagrams, which can be mapped directly with object-oriented languages.

While methods can be made private, often these are omitted from the UML diagram. This is often the case because most programmers find them cluttering the class diagram and they are often created as needed and not important for the outside user.

When modeling software it's normal that not all details are available from the start. For example the type of the attributes should also be documented in the UML diagram, as are the arguments and return types of the methods. However sometimes those details haven't been decided yet. In that case we just leave them out and add them later.

As an example take a look at the UML class diagram of a Hotel Management System below.

Even if your are not an experienced programmer yet, you should be able to understand the concept of the application (not the details, only the general idea) just by looking at the diagram. If that is the case, its usefulness has just been proven.
