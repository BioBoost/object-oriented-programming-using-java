# Starting with JavaFX

In this chapter we will take a look at how to build a basic GUI application using JavaFX. In particular we will be using the FXML approach instead of the code behind approach. This because the FXML approach gives a cleaner GUI from business logic separation by applying the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. FXML can also be easily designed using Scene Builder, which is a Drag n Drop UI designer for JavaFX applications.

<!-- Maybe next year we should first start with a simple hello world in JavaFX code behind -->
