## Chapter 05 - Making Decisions - Multiple Choice

1. How do we call the `number >= 15` part in the if statement below?

    ```java
    if (number >= 15) {
      System.out.println("Sorry, number is too large");
    }
    ```

    * [ ] The assignment
    * [ ] The initialization
    * [ ] A primitive type
    * [ ] The condition

2. When you wish to check if an integral number differs from another integral number, then you need to use the ... operator.

    * [ ] `==`
    * [ ] `!=`
    * [ ] `>=`
    * [ ] `&&`

3. How many `if else` clauses can we add to an if statement?

    * [ ] Maximum 20
    * [ ] Maximum 100
    * [ ] Limited by the RAM in your computer
    * [ ] There is no limitation

4. What is the output of the following code snippet?

    ```java
    boolean x = false;
    boolean y = true;
    int z = 13;

    if (z > 10 || (x != true && y == false)) {
      System.out.println("Sorry, access denied");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Nice one, access granted");
    }
    ```

    * [ ] `Sorry, access denied`
    * [ ] `Nice one, access granted`
    * [ ] Nothing
    * [ ] It crashes
