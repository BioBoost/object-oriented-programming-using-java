# Object Oriented Programming using Java and C++

Welcome to the course Object Oriented Programming (OOP). In this course we will try to learn to become good or better OOP programmers. While the languages used for examples are Java and C++, any or most other OOP programming languages can be used in combination with this course.

This course is actually split in three parts. Two are based on Java and the last is C++.

The third part will also contain some specifics for mBed platforms as they can be programmed in C++. This means that some exercises can only be made on the mBed platform (if there are hardware dependencies). In this case a note will be added to the exercise description.

Most of the material used in this course is created by Nico De Witte. However some paragraphs, definitions, examples, images, ... may be copied from other online sources. In that case a reference can be found in the Sources chapter or as a footnote.

## Requirements

To follow along you will at least need to install Java and an IDE like NetBeans.
