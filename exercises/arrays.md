## Exercises on Arrays

This section contains some exercises on arrays. Try to make them for yourself and test them out in NetBeans.

### Fibonacci numbers

Create a simple application that calculates the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. Save them in a table and calculate the sum of the numbers. It should be _17710_.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that, every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. Start the series at the number 1.

Example:

```text
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
```

### A dice throwing game

Simulate a dice throwing game. Allow the user of your class to select the number of throws that can be simulated. Keep track of the number of eyes (1-6) that is thrown each time in a frequency table.

Add a method that prints out the number of eyes with the frequency and the calculated chance for the number of eyes.


### Search for number

Create a small application that contains an array of random numbers between 0 and 1000.
Add the ability to search the array for a certain number and return the index of the number.


### Sorting

Implement the insertion sort algorithm on an array of numbers. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) for more info.
