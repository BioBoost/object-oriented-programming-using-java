## Exercise 1

Create a program that prints out a message to the user saying hello and stating your name.

## Exercise 2

Determine the result of 2 divided by 3. Next try out 2.0 divided by 3.

## Exercise 3

Take the code below and execute it:

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 2;

double result = a / b;
```

How can you change only the last line to get a result of `2.5`?

## Exercise 4

What is the remainder of 8759 divided by 33?

## Exercise 5

When buying a product in the store you always need to pay VAT. Take for example a pair of shoes that costs 100eur net, you actually pay 121eur.

## Exercise 6

Determine the area of a rectangle with a side of 2.3cm and a side of 8.2cm. Make your program output a decent result to the user.

## Exercise 7

Take the code below and change the variable `fullText` to contain all partial strings before it.

```java
String hello = "Hello sir/madam on this fine day of learning.";
String hackerspace = "I would like to inform you that there will be hackerspace on tuesdays and thursdays.";
String attend = "Feel free to attend it as it will be fun for all.";

String fullText;
```

Print out the variable `fullText` so the whole message is shown to the user.

## Exercise 8

Print the list of numbers from 1 tot 10 to the console.

```text
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

## Exercise 9

Create a program that prints out the number 0 to 10 and states if they are even or uneven. Do the even and uneven check using the remainder operator `%`.

Example output:

```text
0 (even)
1 (uneven)
2 (even)
3 (uneven)
...
10 (even)
```

## Exercise 10
