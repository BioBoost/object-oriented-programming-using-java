## Exercise 1

Determine the result of 2 divided by 3. Next try out 2.0 divided by 3.

## Exercise 2

Take the code below and execute it:

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 2;

double result = a / b;

String hackerspace = "I would like to inform you that there will be hackerspace on tuesdays and thursdays.";
String attend = "Feel free to attend it as it will be fun for all.";
