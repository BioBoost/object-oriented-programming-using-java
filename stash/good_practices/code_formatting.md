## Code Formatting

Always make sure that your code is formatted nice and tightly. Good code reads like a good story. Also make sure to apply formatting rules consistently. Many IDEs and editors such as Visual Code and NetBeans have plugins to prettify your code.

As some developer on CommitStrip once said:

> Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code
> will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

Or as I would of said it:

> Always code as if the **teacher** who ends up **evaluating** your code
> will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
