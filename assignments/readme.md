# Assignments

Create a new project for each assignment. Give it the same name as the exercise. If the exercise consists of multiple steps than you should code all these in the same project. Do not create new projects for each step.

Make sure to upload your solution to the git remote. Also do not forget to add a `README.md` report file to each assignment.
