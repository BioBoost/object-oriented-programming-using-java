## Vehicle Example

Consider a first example that models the classes `Truck`, `Racecar` and `Bus`. Each have a number of attributes and some methods. Below is a partial UML class diagram of the classes modeled without the use of inheritance. Each class has the full functionality implemented into the class itself.

When taking a look at this example it is pretty obvious that the design includes a lot of duplication. This can be solved by creating a **superclass** `Vehicle` that contains all the common attributes and methods of these classes.

Note how some attributes (such as the `trailer` of a `Truck`) and methods (such as `board(passenger)` of `Bus`) cannot be generalized to the `Vehicle` class. They are specific to the subclasses. This is perfectly valid when implementing inheritance.

By placing the common functionality and data inside a superclass a cleaner design is realized that also encourages code reuse.
