# Basic Building Blocks

Almost every programming language out there has a number of basics building blocks required to solve problems and build programs.

* **Variables** label memory locations where data is stored and allow for ease of access.
* **Operators** allow the manipulation of the data stored in memory.
* **Decision making** allows multiple paths of execution based on conditions.
* **Loop constructs** to repeat certain operations a number of times.
* **Functions or procedures** allow functionality to be grouped so it can be easily reused.

More high-level programming languages introduce more advanced tools that allow a developer to create applications for more complex problems without making the application overly complex. Some common concepts are classes, inheritance, interfaces, multithreading, collections, lambda-expressions, generics, ... Some of these will be introduced in the more advanced chapters of this course.
