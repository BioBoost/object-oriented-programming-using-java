# Strings

`String` is probably the most commonly used data type for variables in Java. It is so popular that you actualle already have been using strings since the beginning of this course. Remember your first statement?

```java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

Well, this application was outputting the `String` `"Hello World"` to the terminal.

## String is a Class

A keen eye may also have noticed that while `int`, `double` and such data types are not capitalized, `String` is. That is because `String` is actually a **class**, where those other types are not.

Java actually has two categories of data types:

* **Primitive data types**: char, byte, short, int, long, double, float and boolean.
* **Non-primitive data types**: String, ArrayList, Complex, Random, ...

Primitive data types are simple and integrated in the language (they are most of the time keywords in the language itself). Non-primitive data types are actually classes. This means that when we use the String data type we are actually using objects of the class String. The cool thing about non-primitive data types is that we can create our own as we shall see later in this course.

All you need to know at the moment about a class is the following:

* A class is like a blueprint that is used to create objects from that class.
* The name of a class, in this case `String`, **acts just as a data type**. This means that we can create variables of type `String`. Actually the variable points to **an object of that class**.
* A class internally **contains data**, in the case of a `String` this is a sequence of characters.
* A class **has methods**, which are like actions that can be requested from the objects create from the class.

## Creating Strings

There are two options to create strings. The first we have already used, which is direct assignment of a String literal. The second option is using the approach of using the `new` keyword, as we have done already with classes such as `Scanner` and `Random`.

### Using String literals

The most direct way to create a string is to assign a string **literal** to a variable of type `String` as shown in the next code example.

```java
String greetings = "Hello there. What a fascinating world we live in";

// Print the greetings String to the terminal
System.out.println(greetings);
```

When Java encounters a string literal in our code (`"Hello there. What a fascinating world we live in"` in the previous example), it will automatically create an object of the class `String` and place our literal value inside of it.

### Using the new keyword

As with any other class, you can create objects from classes by using the `new` keyword.

```java
String greetings = new String("Hello there. What a fascinating world we live in");

// Print the greetings String to the terminal
System.out.println(greetings);
```

This approach is the **general way of creating objects from classes**, but is rarely seen in cases of strings. This because the previous approach is shorter.

## Strings have methods

Once an object of `String` exists, **actions can be requested from the object**. This is most often referred to as **calling methods** of the object.

To call a method of an object one can use the following syntax:

```java
object.nameOfMethod();
```

So, calling method is stating its name followed by parentheses `()`. However a method can only be called on an object, so this needs to be specified first by stating the name of the object variable followed by the dot `.` operator.

For example to get the number of characters (whitespace include) that make up the `String`, one can call the `length()` method as shown in the next code snippet.

```java
String hello = "Hello";
int numberOfChars = hello.length();   // 5 in this case

System.out.println("The string " + hello + " has " + numberOfChars + " characters");
```

Take a look at the Java API documentation to find out more about the methods that a String has. It can be found at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/String.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/String.html).

As stated before, a String is internally a sequence of characters. This would suggest that each character is accessible separately. And it is, through the `charAt()` method.

The API documentation of `charAt()`  states the following:

```text
public char charAtâ€‹(int index)

Returns the char value at the specified index. An index ranges from 0 to length() - 1. The first char value of the sequence is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on, as for array indexing.

Parameters:
  index - the index of the char value.
Returns:
    the char value at the specified index of this string. The first char value is at index 0.
```

So to print the characters of a String to the terminal separated by a space, a for loop can be used as shown in the next snippet.

```java
String helloWorld = "Hello World from Java!";

for (int i = 0; i < helloWorld.length(); i++) {
  System.out.print(helloWorld.charAt(i) + " ");
}
// Result: H e l l o   W o r l d   f r o m   J a v a !
```
