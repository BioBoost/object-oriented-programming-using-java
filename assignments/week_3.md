# Week 3

## Assignment - Minimum and Maximum

Create two methods, minimum and maximum. They both take 2 arguments
* `int numberA`
* `int numberB`

The minimum method should return the smallest of the two arguments and the maximum should return the largest of the two arguments.

Create a small program that asks the user to input both numbers. Use both of them as arguments for the minimum and maximum methods. Display the results to the user.

Example:

```
This application will determine the minimum and maximum of two numbers.

Please insert the first number (integer): 15
Please insert the second number (integer): -888

Minimum: -888
Maximum: 15
```
