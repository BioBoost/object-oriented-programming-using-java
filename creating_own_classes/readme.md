# Creating our own Classes

Creating custom classes is one of the main responsibilities of an object oriented programmer. As stated before, an application is a collection of objects that interact with each other. These objects are created based on a class developed by a programmer. If we wish to implement some functionality that is not yet available in the language or it is not exactly what we need, we are required to build it ourselves.

<!-- Luckily even if a class is not readily available for us, we will be able to reuse other classes which contain a partial functionality of the class we which to create. -->

It's natural to think of **objects as collections of other objects**. Think about a television which contains a tuner, a screen, a power supply, an embedded system, ... We say that a television object is **composed** of these other objects. Luckily this same concept is available to us in an object oriented programming language. We can also create objects by bundling other objects. This has the big advantage that we can use objects from classes that someone else made or are part of the language libraries. This saves us a lot of time and effort. This sort of code reuse is one of the major advantages of object oriented languages.
