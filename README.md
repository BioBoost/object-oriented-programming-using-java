# Object Oriented Programming using Java

Welcome to the course Object Oriented Programming (OOP). In this course we will try to learn to become good or better OOP programmers. While the language used for examples is Java, any or most other OOP programming languages can be used in combination with this course.

Most of the material used in this course is created by Nico De Witte. However some paragraphs, definitions, examples, images, ... may be copied from other online sources. In that case a reference can be found in the Sources chapter or as a footnote.
