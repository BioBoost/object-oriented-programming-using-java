# Assignment - Circle Properties

Write a Java program to determine the area and perimeter of a circle. They can be calculated using the formulas below:

```math
area = radius x radius x pi
perimeter = 2 x radius x pi
```

Make sure all the variables are of type `double`.

Print all the parameters to the console (radius, diameter, area and perimeter) so the user had a nice overview.

Allow the user to input the radius of the circle via the console (if you haven't done this yet). You can use the code from the previous assignment. You will have to change the datatype from `int` to `double`.

You can create a variable to hold an approximation to the value of pi. However, Java can supply a more accurate version of PI. Can you find on the Internet how to access/use this value?
