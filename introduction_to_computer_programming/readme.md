# Introduction to Computer Programming

Today, most people don't need to know how a computer works. Most people can simply turn on a computer or a mobile phone and point at some little graphical object on the display, click a button or swipe a finger or two, and the computer does something. How to interact with a computer program is all the average person needs to know.

As a human it is impossible to know how everything works. While people may have a deep understanding of certain things, there will always be other things they don't know or understand. Do you know how a TV actually works? Or do you know the internal workings of a car? However that does not mean we cannot watch TV or drive a car.

Since you are going to learn how to write computer programs, you will need to know a little bit about how a computer works. Your job will be try to instruct the computer to do things you want it to do.

Basically, writing software (computer programs) involves describing processes and procedures; it involves the authoring of algorithms. Computer programming involves developing lists of instructions - the source code representation of software. The stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects, e.g., numbers, words, images, sounds, etc... It has been argued that in its current state, software development is more of an art, not engineering.

An important reason to consider learning about how to program a computer is that the concepts underlying this will be valuable to you, regardless of whether or not you go on to make a career out of it. One thing that you will learn quickly is that a computer is very dumb, but obedient. It does exactly what you tell it to do, which may not necessarily be what you wanted. Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity of expression.

But, most of all, it can be lots of fun! You can think of a computer as your own little entity you get to boss around all day to do all kinds of neat stuff for you.
