# Introduction to Computer Programming

Today, most people don't need to know how a computer works. Most people can simply turn on a computer or a mobile phone and point at some little graphical object on the display, click a button or swipe a finger or two, and the computer does something. How to interact with a computer program is all the average person needs to know.

Since you are going to learn how to write computer programs, you need to know a little bit about how a computer works. Your job will be try to instruct the computer to do things you want it to do.

Basically, writing software (computer programs) involves describing processes and procedures; it involves the authoring of algorithms.  Computer programming involves developing lists of instructions - the source code representation of software  The stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects, e.g., numbers, words, images, sounds, etc...  Creating a computer program can be like composing music, like designing a house, like creating lots of stuff.  It has been argued that in its current state it is an art, not engineering.

An important reason to consider learning about how to program a computer is that the concepts underlying this will be valuable to you, regardless of whether or not you go on to make a career out of it.  One thing that you will learn quickly is that a computer is very dumb, but obedient.  It does exactly what you tell it to do, which is not necessarily what you wanted.  Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity of expression.

But, most of all, it can be lots of fun! You can think of a computer as your own little entity you get to boss around all day to do all kinds of neat stuff for you.

Before we see what a computer programming language looks like, let's use spoken language such as the English language to describe how to do something as a series of steps.  A common exercise that really gets you thinking about what computer programming can be like is to describe a process you are familiar with.

While this is certainly a useful exercise you can already feel that programming in a natural language can become very complex and computers are just not ready for it yet. Heck, most humans aren't even ready for it yet.

> So what will be the result? I expect natural language programming will eventually become ubiquitous as a way of telling computers what to do. People will be able to get started in doing programming-like tasks without learning anything about official “programming” and programming languages: they’ll just converse with their computers as they might converse with another person.
