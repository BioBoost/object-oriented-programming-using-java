## Chapter 02 - Basic Building Blocks - Challenges

### Smartphone

Take a look at the CoolBlue website for one of the latest models of smartphones. What data would you require to store some of the most common properties of a smartphone product? Propose names for variables for each.

### Car or Motorcycle

Image you needed to create a website to sell cars or motorcycles (pick for yourself). What data would you need to store about each car? Name at least 5. Propose names for variables for each.

### BMI Personalization

Extend the BMI example (section on operators) to ask the user for his/her name and gender so a more personalized message can be outputted to the terminal.

What if the person did not like to provide its name. How would you handle that? Can you model it in the flowchart?

### BMI Adult Check

Extend the BMI example (section on operators) to ask the user for his/her age. If the persons age is below 18, output a message that the calculated BMI is not accurate as the person is not an adult.

### Student Grader

Model an application using a flowchart that asks the user to give his/her grade for a particular course. If its below average output an encouraging message, if its above average give a well done. If it's a perfect score output an original message.

### Rectangle Area

Use a flowchart to model an application that calculates the area of a rectangle (width times height). Request the data from the user.

### Summing a List of Numbers

Create a flowchart of a process that asks the user for 5 numbers. Make the sum of all the numbers the user gave. Output the result to the terminal. Also list the variables that you expect to need for this.
