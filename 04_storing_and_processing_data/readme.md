# Storing and processing data

The programs that we create need to store all sorts of data. From simple things such as numbers, characters and string to complex data types that a programmer can define for himself.

This data is stored, manipulated and outputted through our application. The data itself is stored inside the memory of the computer or system the program is running on. Inside your application you do not need to access the memory directly, for this you can make use of variables.
