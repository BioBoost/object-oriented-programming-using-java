## Exercise 3 - Randomizer checker

Create an application that calculates the average of a number of randomly generated numbers.

You can use the `nextInt(max)` method of the class `Random` to generate random integers.
Make sure to select a low max (for example 50) or your sum will overflow.

Make a small main program to show that the implementation works. Generate for example 5000 random numbers.
