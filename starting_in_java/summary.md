### Summary

Arrays are:

* Fixed-size, meaning that ones their size is set they cannot be resized.
* Single-typed, meaning they can only hold 1 type of data.
* Zero-indexed, meaning that the first element is located at position 0.
* Sequential collections, meaning that the elements are positioned one after another in memory.
* Ordered, meaning that the order of the elements will not change unless you change them.
