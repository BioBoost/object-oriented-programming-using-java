# Hands-on - Visualizing Sensor Data

This hands-on tutorial will guide you through the exercise of building a small application that stores and displays sensor data. The guide will demonstrate how to do this for a temperature sensor and will encourage you to build your own other sensors and graphs.

Our goal is to emulate a device that generates a temperature value and display that on a visual chart in JavaFX. While several approaches can be considered into solving this problem, this tutorial starts by visualizing some random data and building upon that.
