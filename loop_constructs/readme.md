# Loop Constructs

There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a block is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

Java programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements:

* **for loop**: Execute a code block multiple times and simplify the code that manages the loop variable.
* **while loop**: Repeats a code block while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the body of the loop.
* **do-while loop**: Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
