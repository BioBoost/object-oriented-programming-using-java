## Assignment - Guessing Game

For this assignment there are a few basic requirements. For the rest you can show some creative behavior.

Create a guessing game where a number is generated randomly and the user needs to guess it. Search the Internet on how to generate a random number in Java. When a user inputs his/her guess, the game should state if it is too high or too low. Keep some sort of score for the user.

At the beginning of the game make sure to give some instructions to the player on how it works. At the end of a round ask the user if he/she wishes to play again. Display the number of guesses a player needed to guess the number and also display his/her score.

Make sure to track the best score of the player throughout his/her different rounds and display it when the player stops playing.

Some extras:
* You could ask the user's name to make the game more personal.
* You could create a report with an overview of the scores of the player for each round. The simplest solution here would me to create a String and append the results to it each round.

Don't forget to add a markdown report to the project.
