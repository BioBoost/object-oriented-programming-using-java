## Inheritance in Java

To implement inheritance in Java all you need is a base class and a subclass. The subclass needs to **extend** the base class and this can be accomplished by using the `extends` keyword as shown below in the code template.

```java
public class <subclass> extends <baseclass> {
  // Implementation
}
```

Note that *extending* the base class is exactly what we are doing when implementing inheritance. We take a general class and add something to it: data, behavior or both.
