### Challenge 3

Take the code below and execute it:

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 2;

double result = a / b;
```

How can you change only the last line to get a result of `2.5`?

### Challenge 4

What is the remainder of 8759 divided by 33?

### Challenge 5

When buying a product in the store you always need to pay VAT (taxes). Take for example a pair of shoes that costs 100eur net, you actually pay 121eur.
