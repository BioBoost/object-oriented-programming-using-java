## Complex Numbers

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form `a + bi`, where a and b are real numbers, and `i` is a solution of the equation `x^2 = âˆ’1`, which is called an imaginary number because there is no real number that satisfies this equation. For the complex number `a + bi`, `a` is called the real part, and `b` is called the imaginary part.
