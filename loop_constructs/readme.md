# Loop Constructs

In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a block is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may however be situations where you need to execute a block of code several number of times. Programming languages provide various structures that allow you to loop a block of statements.

Java programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements:

* **for loop**: Execute a code block multiple times and simplify the code that manages the loop variable.
* **while loop**: Repeats a code block while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the body of the loop.
* **do-while loop**: Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
