## Challenges

### Data Types

In the most left column is a piece of data that is stored inside of the computers memory. What would be a possible data type for each piece of information? In some cases multiple data types would be valid.

| Data | byte | int | double | boolean | char | String |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| -12 | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| a | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| Hello World | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| 108.6 | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| true | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| Spoorwegstraat 12, 8200 Brugge | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| A | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| 0471 11 18 23 | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| 3.14 | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| x | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| ZZ Top | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| false | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |
| -778.81323 | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] | [] |

### Basic Division

Determine the result of 2 divided by 3. Next try out 2.0 divided by 3.

### Floating Point Division

Take the code below and execute it:

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 2;

double result = a / b;
```

How can you change only the last line to get a result of `2.5`?

### Remainder

What is the remainder of 8759 divided by 33?

### Calculating VAT

When buying a product in the store you always need to pay VAT (taxes). Take for example a pair of shoes that costs 100eur net, you actually pay 121eur.

Write a program that calculates how much the total bill would be if the net amount is 250eur.

### Rectangle Area

Determine the area of a rectangle with a side of 2.3cm and a side of 8.2cm. Make your program outputs a decent result to the user.

### String Concatenation

Take the code below and change the variable `fullText` to contain all partial strings before it.

```java
String hello = "Hello sir/madam on this fine day of learning.";
String hackerspace = "I would like to inform you that there will be hackerspace on tuesdays and thursdays.";
String attend = "Feel free to attend it as it will be fun for all.";

String fullText;
```

Print out the variable `fullText` so the whole message is shown to the user.

## Circle Properties

Write a Java program to determine the area and perimeter of a circle. They can be calculated using the formulas below:

```math
area = radius x radius x pi
perimeter = 2 x radius x pi
```

Make sure all the variables are of type `double`.

Print all the parameters to the terminal (radius, diameter, area and perimeter) so the user had a nice overview.

You can create a variable to hold an approximation to the value of pi. However, Java can supply a more accurate version of PI. Can you find on the Internet how to access/use this value?
