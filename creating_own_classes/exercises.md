## Exercise 1 - Modeling an Advanced Light Bulb

Take the example from the course of a LightBulb. Now think about a more advanced light bulb where you wish to keep track of the number of hours that it was on (it breaks for example after 10'000 hours). Instead of two states this lightbulb can be dimmed. How would you save that property? Create a UML diagram of this LEDBulb.

## Exercise 2 - Circumference and area of a parallelogram

Create a class that stores the base and height of a parallelogram.

![Parallelogram](img/parallelogram.png)

Add two methods to the class. One to determine the area and one to determine the circumference of the parallelogram.

Make a small main program to show that the implementation works.

## Exercise 3 - A resistor model

Create a class that simulates the behavior of a resistor. You should be able
to only set the resistance once through a constructor of the class. This means that
the resistance cannot change after an object of the Resistor class has been created.

![Resistor](img/resistor.jpg)

You should supply methods to set the current that passes through the resistor.
In this case the resulting voltage is calculated using U = I x R.

It should also be possible to change the voltage that is applied across the resistor.
In that case the resulting current through the resistor should be calculated using
I = U / R.

You should make sure that the created objects are in a valid state at all times. This
means if the current changes, the voltage should also change and vice versa.

Make sure to choose floating point values for all attributes of the resistor class.

Make sure that the following main code works:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Resistor resistor = new Resistor(1000);
  Resistor bridge = new Resistor();

  resistor.setVoltage(1);
  System.out.println("Current = " + resistor.getCurrent() + " A");
  // Current = 0.001 A
}
```

## Exercise 4 - A Command Parser

Write an application that can call a number of methods based on the commands that the user types in the terminal. So for example implement the following commands:

* help: give a list of available commands
* exit: stop and exit the application
* say <message>: print a message to the terminal

Example:

```text
> say Hello world at all
Hello world at all
> help
The following commands are available:
  help: give a list of available commands
  exit: stop and exit the application
  say <message>: print a message to the terminal
> exit
Bye bye, see you next time.
```

## Exercise 5 - A Player List

Create a class Player that holds both a nickname (of type `string`) and his/her score (of type `int`).

Next create a class PlayerList that contains an expandable list of players (use for example an `ArrayList` for this). Create methods for your PlayerList class to add a player and to remove a player. To remove a player you will need to give his/her nickname as an argument to the remove method. Also add a method to find a player based on his/her nickname.

The following main method should work with your classes:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Player exeler = new Player("Exeler");
  exeler.addPoints(23);
  System.out.println("Player " + exeler.getNickname()
      + " has " + exeler.getPoints() + " points");

  final int MAX_PLAYERS = 5;
  PlayerList joinedPlayers = new PlayerList(MAX_PLAYERS);

  if (joinedPlayers.add(exeler)) {
    System.out.println("Player joined");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Cannot join. List is full");
  }
}
```

## Exercise 6 - Complex Number

Create a class `Complex` to model a complex number.

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x2 = âˆ’1, which is called an imaginary number because there is no real number that satisfies this equation. For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part.

Model your class so the following code works:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Complex number = new Complex(3, 15);
    Complex base = new Complex(22, 11);
    Complex origin = new Complex();

    base.add(number);       // Result ? 25,26

    System.out.println(base.toString());
    System.out.println(base);   // Implicit call toString()
}
```

and would output this:

```text
[26, 25i]
[26, 25i]
```

## Exercise 7 - ToDo list printer

Create a small application that can hold a list of todo items. A todo item consists of a small descriptive string.

Allow the user of your application to create todo items. Track them in a list. This list should have a title. You do not need to implement functionality to complete to-do's and so on. The application just needs to be able to create an overview of todo items.

When the user is ready with adding items print them to the terminal in a nice form.

For example (be creative):
```text
ToDo by this weekend:
---------------------
[ ] Mow the lawn
[ ] Visit grandpa
[ ] Solve exercises for OOP1
[ ] Clean the bike
[ ] Read book on Databases
[ ] Study for exam of WebTech
```

Check out the  in the solution section.

[solution](../creating_own_classes/solutions.md#Exercise 7 - ToDo list printer)

Extra:
Add a priority to a todo item and sort the list of items based on the priority (highest on top). Decide for yourself how to implement the priority:
* for example integer value between 0 and 5
* or just a `boolean` to indicate high priorities

Example:
```text
ToDo by this weekend:
---------------------
High priorities
[ ] Read book on Databases
[ ] Study for exam of WebTech
[ ] Visit grandpa
[ ] Solve exercises for OOP1

Low priorities
[ ] Clean the bike
[ ] Mow the lawn
```
