## Summary

Inheritance allows a class to inherit (get) the properties and methods of another class. In other words, the **subclass** inherits the states and behaviors from the **base class**. The subclass is also called the **derived class** while the base class is also known as the **super-class**. The derived class can add its own additional attributes and methods. These additional attributes and methods differentiates the derived class from the base class.

A super-class can have any number of subclasses. But a subclass can have only one superclass. This is because Java does not support *multiple inheritance*.
